# Function Impace Analyser

This app lets you input a function and determines its characteristics with regards to running time and impact on users. It tries to provide advice on what to do with the function to improve user experience.

This is still very experimental! There is no build process, just the files found in this folder.

# Demo

[GitHub Pages Demo](https://jamesmilneruk.github.io/functionimpact/)

# TODO

It would be nice to do the following:

- Determine if a function will cause composite, layout, paint etc in the DOM
- Use more robust determination of DOM access and Promise resolve/reject usage, potentially via esprima or some more powerful regexs
